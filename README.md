SCA - Software Composition Analysis Tool

This is SCA, a software composition analysis tool used to scan applications for vulnerable software. SCA is in the works and will be able to scan all of the tools, to include javascript libraries, .nugets, and css libraries used in building an application. After scanning the given application, the compare will run to see if any of the given software has known vulnerbilities, and if so what actions/upgrades-secure-versions you will need to do.
